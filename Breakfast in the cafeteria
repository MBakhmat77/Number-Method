 Breakfast in the cafeteria

// The 30-storey building has two cafeterias located on floors n and m.

// The cafeteria on floor n is called "Nonstop", the cafeteria on floor m is called "Merci".

// You work on floor x and want to have breakfast at the nearest cafeteria. Which cafeteria
// will you go to?

// Write a function named nearestCafe that takes three different numbers x, n, m as arguments
// (x is the floor where you are; n, m are the floors where the cafeterias are located) and 
// returns the name of the nearest cafeteria. If the number
// of floors to the cafeterias is the same, you prefer to have breakfast in the "Merci" cafe
